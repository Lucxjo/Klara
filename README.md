# Klara
Klara aims to be a multipurpose bot for discord built on Discord.JS. Currently, the bot doesn't do much but I'm working on that!

## Build
### Docker
There is a Dockerfile within this repository which can be built with `docker build -t klara .` and then run with `docker run -d --env DJS_TOKEN= klara` *remember to add your token after DJS_TOKEN=*
